# External Parts list
## Here is what you need to purchase to complete this build:

* 3D printed parts included in this GitHub.
* Adafruit [ItsyBitsy M4 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800). Be sure to get the male and female headers as well! You'll need both to build yourself.
* Stepper motor driver, with equivalent pinout to [this one using the TMC2209 driver](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPV4HFP/).
* 1.8° stepper motor. Either [NEMA-17](https://www.amazon.com/STEPPERONLINE-Bipolar-Stepper-22-6oz-Extruder/dp/B00PNEQ79Q/) or [NEMA-11](https://www.amazon.com/Iverntech-Stepper-Printer-Machine-Robotics/dp/B07PNV7RBW/) will work with the unit as designed.
* Adjustable AC/DC power supply. I usually use [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N18XN84/) since it has other tips to use long0-term. __This setup runs at 7.5V__.
* [Silicone tubing](https://www.amazon.com/VictorsHome-Silicone-Flexible-Transfer-Transparent/dp/B09DKWWRSG) with 0.5 mm wall thickness. O.D. does not matter; pump works with 2 mm O.D. – 4 mm O.D. tubing.
* 4-wire pressure transducer. I prefer [these disposable ones from MedLine](https://www.medline.com/product/Head/Z05-PF154670). You can either replace the RJ-11 connector or just cut the robber off to make it more accessible.
* Luer connectors. But if you're reading this, it's my guess you have a box of them in your lab somewhere anyway. (c:
* 3/16" (or 5 mm) set screws. The design used 4-40 thread size since I'm in the USA, but any roughly equivalent diameter will work. 3 are needed for the pump wheel.
* Miscellaneous M3 button cap hex machine screws. Nothing fancy, but the length will depend on which motor you choose.
* *PCB with 2-channel custom instrumentation amplifier, integrated stepper motor control and 16-bit ADC (availability and cost is pending for the moment).*

## Note on the PCB:
So there are probably other ways to do this off-the-shelf, but I designed and built a board for this. I am working on how to make it available through my facilities here at MSU, so please be patient. If you're good at soldering and have a forced-air soldering device, this is doable as a DIY. Otherwise it takes me about 90 minutes to put one together. Futher details on this are available by request.
