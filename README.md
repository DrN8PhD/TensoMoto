# TensoMoto
## Monitor and control cannulated vessel pressure in one easy-to-build unit

This arduino-based code is used to program the TensoMoto controller.
Paired with VasoTracker2 software, intravascular pressure can be monitored and controlled without the need for costly interface units.

This system is also capable of simulating pulsatile changes in pressure at rates approaching normal murine heart rate (~400 bpm).
